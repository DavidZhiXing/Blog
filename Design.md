## Agv robot control system
1. Identify the domain model. You would first need to identify the core domain concepts. These concepts could include things like AGVs, pick-up and drop-off locations, and navigation maps. Next, using the DDD pattern to design the system, one of the DDD pattern is entity pattern. Entities have a unique identify and a set of attributes that describe their state. Another pattern is Value Object. Value objects that represent the properties or attributes of other objects.The third pattern is Aggregates. Aggregates are groups of related enties that are treated as a single unit. 
- AGV robot. Such as a forklift, pallet jack, or tugger.
- Waypoint. Such as a point on a map.
- Path. Such as the shortest path between two points on a map.
- Map. Such as a map of a warehouse.
- Task. Such as "pick up", "drop off", "move", and "wait".
- Station. Such as pick-up and drop-off locations.
- StationType. Such as "pick-up", "drop-off", and "wait".
- Sensor reading. Such as the robot's position and orientation.
- Actuator command.
- Robot status. Such as "idle", "executing task", and "error".
- Robot command. Such as "move", "stop", "turn left", and "turn right".
- Robot type. Such as "forklift", "pallet jack", and "tugger".
- Feet manergement system
- Task management system
2. Design the domain services.
- Mission planner. Such as planning the sequence of tasks that an AGV robot should execute.
- Path planner. Such as finding the shortest path between two points on a map.
- Motion Controller. Such as controlling the robot's speed and direction.
- Sensor fusion. Such as combining data from multiple sensors to determine the robot's position and orientation.
- robot navigation
- feet management. Such as robot registration, robot status monitoring, and robot command execution.
- task assignment
- task execution
3. Implement the application layer. The application layer is responsible fro exposing the system's functionality to users and other systems. It should be designed to be independent of the domain model and domain services. 
- User interface
- Fleet manager
- Integration with other systems

## Task Management System
1. Domain Model
- Task
- Task Status. such as created, assigned, executing, completed, and canceled.
- Task priority. Such as low, medium, and high.
- Task dependency. Such as "Task A must be completed before Task B can be started."
- Task type. Such as "pick up", "drop off", "move", and "wait".
- Task parameters. Such as the location of a pick-up or drop-off station.
- Task assignment
- Task execution
2. business processes
- Task creation
- Task assignment
- Task excution
- Task monitoring
- Task reporting
3. Implement the domain medel. It is important to focus on the behavior of the domain objects, rather than the implement details.
4. Develop the application
- A user interface for createing, editing, and managing agv tasks
- A task schedular for assigning tasks to AGV robots
- A task monitor for tracking the status of AGV tasks
- A task reporting module for generationg reports on AGV tasks.
- A task history for vieving the history of completed tasks.
## Fleet Management System
1. Domain Model
- AGV performance matrics. Such as the number of tasks completed per hour, the distance traveled, the number of charging cycles, and the number of errors.
2. business processes
- Robot registration
- Robot status monitoring
- Robot command execution

## Map Component
1. Domain Model
- robot
- map
- Map Layer
- map layer type
- map layer data
- map layer style
- Map node: A map node is a point on a map. It can be used to represent a pick-up or drop-off location, a charging station, or a point on a path.
- Map node type: such as "pick-up", "drop-off", "charging station", and "path point".
- Map edge: a map edge is a line segment on a map. It connects two map nodes.
- Map zone: a map zone
- path
- obstacle
2. business processes
- map creation
- map editing
- path planning
- path execution
- obstacle avoidance
3. Application Layer
- A map editor for creating and editing maps
- A path planner for finding the shortest path between two points on a map
- A obstacle avoidance module for avoiding obstacles during navigation
4. Additional Tips
- Use a layerd approach. The map can be divided into multiple layers, such as a base layer, a path layer, and an obstacle layer.
- Use a standard format. Such as ROS map format.
- Use a hierarchical structure: with different levels of detail for different zoom levels. this will improve the performance of the map loading and rendering.
- Using dynamic updates: The map should be dynamically updated to reflect changes in the environment. such as the addition or removal of obstacles. 
- Use a variety of naviation algorithms to support different types of Agv navigation tasks, such as point-to-point navigation, path following, and pic-and-place navigation.

## Motion Controller
1. Domain Model
- Robot
- Motion Controller: is a device that controls the movement of an agv robot.
- Motion profile: is a description of the desired movement of an agv rovot, including its position, velocity, and acceleration over time.
- Motion Command: is a command tha is sent to the motion controller to control the movement of a agv robot.
- Motion state
- Motion feedback: is data that is received from motion controller about the current state of the AGV robot, such as its possition, velocity, and acceleration.
2. Business process
- Motion control
- Motion planning
- Motion executing
- Motion monitoring
3. Application
- A user interface for sending motion commands to the motion controller
- A motion state monitor for tracking the current state of the robot

4. Tips
- Use a variety of motion control algorithms to support different types of agv robot movement, such as linear motion, curcular motion, and trajectory tracking.
