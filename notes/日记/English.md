- 大家好，我的中文名字是 韦志星，英文名字是Star Wei, Star 在中文就是星的意思
> Hello, my Chinese name is Wei ZhiXing, my English name is Star Wei, Star means '星' in Chinese

- 我来自广东深圳，大学在桂林电子科技大学读的电子信息工程专业，2010年毕业
> I come from Shenzhen, Guangdong, China. I graduated from Guilin University of Electronic Technology in 2010

- 我的第一份工作是桂林赛普科技有限科技公司
> My first job was at Guilin Saipu Technology Co., Ltd.

- 工作内容是：采集变电站设备的数据，进行存储和分析，然后通过界面展示给用户，用户可以通过界面进行操作，比如控制开关，安全检查结果输入等等
  
> My job was to collect data from substations, store and analyze the data, and then display the data to users through the interface. Users can operate the interface, such as controlling switches, and entering safety check results, etc.
>
- 用到的技术栈是: winform vs2010 c# sqlserver 三层架构
> The technology stack used was: winform vs2010 c# sqlserver three-layer architecture

- 我在这家工作是从2009到2010年底，从一个不懂两个对话框如何交换数据，什么是数据库，什么是Sql，什么是控件，成长成为了一个初级工程师，可以接一些简单的工作了

> I worked there from 2009 to the end of 2010. I grew from a person who didn't know how two dialog boxes exchanged data, what a database was, what Sql was, and what a control was, to a junior engineer who could take on some simple work.

### 常見問題
- 碰到什麽有挑戰的問題？ 或者有成就感的事情？
  - 每個階段的問題不一樣，做我早期階段，可能的挑戰就是通過調試解決一個BUG, 完成兩個對話框的數據交換，封裝和使用控件，使用sql語句賽選分析數據
  > The challenges of each stage are different. In the early stages, the challenges may be to solve a BUG through debugging, complete the data exchange of two dialog boxes, encapsulate and use controls, and use sql statements to select and analyze data.
  - 當我處於中級階段時，可能是瞭解並實現一個新的設計模式，瞭解多綫程之間的靜態關係，能夠藉鑒他人的設計解決儅謬的業務問題，成功使用單元測試，提升服務器的吞吐量，拿到理想公司的Offer
  > When I was in the middle stage, it might be to understand and implement a new design pattern, understand the static relationship between multiple threads, be able to solve the business problem of a mistake by referring to the design of others, successfully use unit testing, and improve the throughput of the server. Get the Offer of the ideal company.
  - 當我處於高級工程師階段，我的挑戰是給出一個良好的設計，通過code review或者分享提升團隊開發水平，跨國合作開發，幫助他人解決一些問題，獨立解決疑難問題，如内存泄漏，異常Crash，深刻瞭解GC的原理, 準確評估任務時間以及風險點
  > When I was in the senior engineer stage, my challenge was to give a good design, improve the team development level through code review or sharing, cross-border cooperation development, help others solve some problems, independently solve difficult problems such as memory leaks, abnormal crashes, and deeply understand the principles of GC，accurately evaluate the time and risk points of the task

### 部分总结
- 我总共工作了12年，大概曾经服务过6家公司，但主要的就3家吧，从事的行业有物联网，互联网，工业机器人控制，医疗器械
> I have worked for around 12 years in total, and I have served about 6 companies, but mainly 3, in the fields of Internet of Things, Internet, industrial robot control, and medical equipment
- 全说起来可能有点长，不知道你们是想要全部了解，还是只听我说一说其中几家公司？
> It may be a bit long to say it all, I don't know if you want to know all the detail, or just listen to me talk about a few companies?
- 我大学曾经休学了两年，因为家里的一些原因，加上自己当初也有一些迷茫，在游戏中去找成就感了
> I took a break from college for two years because of some family reasons, and I also had some confusion at the beginning, so I went to find a sense of achievement in the game
- 大一的一年我每天都去图书馆，去那里看c++和C#的书籍，在图书馆的计算机上用ActionScript编写Flash网站，但这导致了我与同学基本上没什么交流，因为他们经常去网吧玩游戏，后来我觉得需要跟他们增加感情，也就一》起去玩游戏，没想到如同打开了我的新世界一样，这个游戏我就一直玩了5年，经常不去上课和通宵，算是当时走的一段迷茫的路吧
> In my first year of college, I went to the library every day to read books on C++ and C# and use ActionScript to write Flash websites on the computers in the library, but this led to me having very little communication with my classmates, because they often went to Internet cafes to play games. Later, I felt that I needed to increase my feelings with them, so I started playing games with them. I didn't expect that it was like opening a new world for me. I played this game for 5 years, often not going to class and staying up all night. It was a way of confusion at that time.
- 不过也不算是完全的荒废学业，我还是很喜欢看编程的书籍，以及给游戏写自定义的脚本
> But it wasn't completely wasted, I still like to read programming books, and write custom scripts for games via lua####

### 部分问答
- 谢谢你的信息，我会尽力做到最好。然后我有两个问题想要咨询一下：
  我是否可以对视频进行录制，我不会分享到网络，只是用于事后总结
  我是否可以使用一些翻译软件，虽然我英语有一些自信，但我担心沟通中可能会遗漏一些信息，并且沟通中我可能会进行一些输入，以达到更好的沟通效果
> Thank you for your information, I will do my best. Then I have two questions to consult:
>   Can I record the video? I won't share it on the Internet, just for later summary
>   Can I use some translation software? Although I have some confidence in English, I am worried that I may miss some information in communication, and I may make some input to PC during communication to make communication more effective
