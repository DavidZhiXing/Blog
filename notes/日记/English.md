> The technology stack used was: winform vs2010 c# sqlserver three-layer architecture

- 我在这家工作是从2009到2010年底，从一个不懂两个对话框如何交换数据，什么是数据库，什么是Sql，什么是控件，成长成为了一个初级工程师，可以接一些简单的工作了

> I worked there from 2009 to the end of 2010. I grew from a person who didn't know how two dialog boxes exchanged data, what a database was, what Sql was, and what a control was, to a junior engineer who could take on some simple work.

- 我在这个公司工作从2011年到2015年，从一个初级工程师成长成为一个中级工程师，同时相信无论什么软件都能够参与开发设计了，即使是自己暂时没掌握的东西，也可以通过搜索和调试完成开发。于是开始了间隔年，想做一些自己的事情
> I worked there from 2011 to 2015. I grew from a junior engineer to a mid-level engineer. At the same time, I believe that I can participate in the development and design of any software, even if I don't master it temporarily. I can complete the development through search and debugging. So I started the gap year, and wanted to do something for myself.

- 不幸的是：独立开发者和打工不是一样的事情，我还要很多东西没有准备好，包括心理上的，所以做一个独立开发者算是失败了，继续回来找工作。
> Unfortunately, independent developers and working are not the same thing. I still have a lot of things that are not ready, including psychologically, so it is considered a failure to be an independent developer, and continue to look for work.

- 在这家公司工作的时间是2016年到2017年差不多一年半时间，离开是因为这家公司的业务在2017年下半年被认为是违法了，公司停止了运营，虽然创始人又创建了一家新的公司，但我并没有加入。
> The time I worked in this company was almost a year and a half from 2016 to 2017. I left because the business of this company was considered illegal in the second half of 2017, and the company stopped operating. Although the founder created a new company, I did not join.

The plugin I participated in developing is a plugin that can exchange data between PC and mobile phone, which is convenient for PC to manage multiple mobile phone SMS, photos, and files, and develop some functions that need to cooperate with PC and mobile phone to play or are more convenient, such as SMS group sending, mainly for overseas customers，The mobile phone software is developed by the Indian Motorola team, and communicates with the PC plug-in developed by us
    - 虽然这个项目感觉后面是失败了，没有什么用户，但我认为并不是我们团队的问题，而已领导层的决策问题
    > Although this project feels that it failed later, there are not many users, but I think it is not our team's problem, its the decision-making problem of the leadership
  - 第二个项目名称叫BTIT，主要是一个物联网服务，可以管理所有出售的智能音箱，智能插座，远程控制，数据采集, 设备和服务监控等，这个项目开发半年之后被另外一个比较大的团队抢走了。
    > The second project is called BTIT, which is mainly an IoT service that can manage all the smart speakers, smart sockets, remote control, data collection, device and service monitoring, etc. that are sold. This project was developed for half a year before it was taken away by another larger team.
  - 第三个项目叫LIPC，是一个拥有数百个服务的系统中的一个微服务，是一个订单代理系统，负责门户网站和账户服务系统的请求转发，和部分数据的处理，这个项目是我们与美国、乌克兰团队合作开发的，项目进展略微缓慢，到我离开的时候几乎没有什么任务和需求分配过来了
    > The third project is called LIPC, which is a microservice in a system with hundreds of services. It is an order proxy system that is responsible for forwarding requests from the portal website and account service system, and processing part of the data.
