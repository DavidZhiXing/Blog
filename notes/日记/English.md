- 大家好，我的中文名字是 韦志星，英文名字是Star Wei, Star 在中文就是星的意思
> Hello, my Chinese name is ZhiXing Wei , my English name is Star Wei, Star means '星' in Chinese

- 我来自广东深圳，大学在桂林电子科技大学读的电子信息工程专业，2010年毕业
> I come from Shenzhen, Guangdong, China. I graduated from Guilin University of Electronic Technology in 2010

- 我的第一份工作是桂林赛普科技有限科技公司
> My first job was at Guilin Saipu Technology Co., Ltd.

- 工作内容是：采集变电站设备的数据，进行存储和分析，然后通过界面展示给用户，用户可以通过界面进行操作，比如控制开关，安全检查结果输入等等

>
- 用到的技术栈是: winform vs2010 c# sqlserver 三层架构
> The technology stack used was: winform vs2010 c# sqlserver three-layer architecture

- 我在这家工作是从2009到2010年底，从一个不懂两个对话框如何交换数据，什么是数据库，什么是Sql，什么是控件，成长成为了一个初级工程师，可以接一些简单的工作了

> I worked there from 2009 to the end of 2010. I grew from a person who didn't know how two dialog boxes exchanged data, what a database was, what Sql was, and what a control was, to a junior engineer who could take on some simple work.

### 常見問題
- 碰到什麽有挑戰的問題？ 或者有成就感的事情？
  - 每個階段的問題不一樣，做我早期階段，可能的挑戰就是通過調試解決一個BUG, 完成兩個對話框的數據交換，封裝和使用控件，使用sql語句賽選分析數據
  > The challenges of each stage are different. In the early stages, the challenges may be to solve a BUG through debugging, complete the data exchange of two dialog boxes, encapsulate and use controls, and use sql statements to select and analyze data.
  - 當我處於中級階段時，可能是瞭解並實現一個新的設計模式，瞭解多綫程之間的靜態關係，能夠藉鑒他人的設計解決儅謬的業務問題，成功使用單元測試，提升服務器的吞吐量，拿到理想公司的Offer
  > When I was in the middle stage, it might be to understand and implement a new design pattern, understand the static relationship between multiple threads, be able to solve the business problem of a mistake by referring to the design of others, successfully use unit testing, and improve the throughput of the server. Get the Offer of the ideal company.
  - 當我處於高級工程師階段，我的挑戰是給出一個良好的設計，通過code review或者分享提升團隊開發水平，跨國合作開發，幫助他人解決一些問題，獨立解決疑難問題，如内存泄漏，異常Crash，深刻瞭解GC的原理, 準確評估任務時間以及風險點
  > When I was in the senior engineer stage, my challenge was to give a good design, improve the team development level through code review or sharing, cross-border cooperation development, help others solve some problems, independently solve difficult problems such as memory leaks, abnormal crashes, and deeply understand the principles of GC，accurately evaluate the time and risk points of the task

### 部分总结
- 我总共工作了12年，大概曾经服务过6家公司，但主要的就3家吧，从事的行业有物联网，互联网，工业机器人控制，医疗器械
> I have worked for around 12 years in total, and I have served about 6 companies, but mainly 3, in the fields of Internet of Things, Internet, industrial robot control, and medical equipment
- 全说起来可能有点长，不知道你们是想要全部了解，还是只听我说一说其中几家公司？
> It may be a bit long to say it all, I don't know if you want to know all the detail, or just listen to me talk about a few companies?
- 我大学曾经休学了两年，因为家里的一些原因，加上自己当初也有一些迷茫，在游戏中去找成就感了
> I took a break from college for two years because of some family reasons, and I also had some confusion at the beginning, so I went to find a sense of achievement in the game
- 大一的一年我每天都去图书馆，去那里看c++和C#的书籍，在图书馆的计算机上用ActionScript编写Flash网站，但这导致了我与同学基本上没什么交流，因为他们经常去网吧玩游戏，后来我觉得需要跟他们增加感情，也就一》起去玩游戏，没想到如同打开了我的新世界一样，这个游戏我就一直玩了5年，经常不去上课和通宵，算是当时走的一段迷茫的路吧
> In my first year of college, I went to the library every day to read books on C++ and C# and use ActionScript to write Flash websites on the computers in the library, but this led to me having very little communication with my classmates, because they often went to Internet cafes to play games. Later, I felt that I needed to increase my feelings with them, so I started playing games with them. I didn't expect that it was like opening a new world for me. I played this game for 5 years, often not going to class and staying up all night. It was a way of confusion at that time.
- 不过也不算是完全的荒废学业，我还是很喜欢看编程的书籍，以及给游戏写自定义的脚本
> But it wasn't completely wasted, I still like to read programming books, and write custom scripts for games via lua####

### 部分问答
- 谢谢你的信息，我会尽力做到最好。然后我有两个问题想要咨询一下：
  我是否可以对视频进行录制，我不会分享到网络，只是用于事后总结
  我是否并对所有物联网设备进行管理，比如设备的注册，设备的升级，设备的控制等等。
> My second job was at Shenzhen M2Mciro Technology Co., Ltd. My job was to collect data from IoT devices, store and analyze the data, and manage all IoT devices, such as device registration, device upgrades, and device control.
>
- 当初开发的设备是：数百个智能电表，智能插座，智能水表等
> The devices developed at the time were: hundreds of smart meters, smart sockets, smart water meters, etc.
> 
- 所有的设备有一个集中的网关负责与PC的通讯器进行数据交换，每个通讯器是动态生成，并发控制的。

- 我在这个公司工作从2011年到2015年，从一个初级工程师成长成为一个中级工程师，同时相信无论什么软件都能够参与开发设计了，即使是自己暂时没掌握的东西，也可以使用一些翻译软件，虽然我英语有一些自信，但我担心沟通中可能会遗漏一些信息，并且沟通中我可能会进行一些输入，以达到更好的沟通效果
> Thank you for your information, I will do my best. Then I have two questions to consult:
>   Can I record the video? I won't share it on the Internet, just for later summary
>   Can I use some translation software? Although I have some confidence in English, I am worried that I may miss some information in communication, and I may make some input to PC during communication to make communication more effective

通过搜索和调试完成开发。于是开始了间隔年，想做一些自己的事情
> I worked there from 2011 to 2015. I grew from a junior engineer to a mid-level engineer. At the same time, I believe that I can participate in the development and design of any software, even if I don't master it temporarily. I can complete the development through search and debugging. So I started the gap year, and wanted to do something for myself.
>
- 不幸的是：独立开发者和打工不是一样的事情，我还要很多东西没有准备好，包括心理上的，所以做一个独立开发者算是失败了，继续回来找工作。
> Unfortunately, independent developers and working are not the same thing. I still have a lot of things that are not ready, including psychologically, so it is considered a failure to be an independent developer, and continue to look for work.
>
- 于是开始了第三份工作，是深圳一元云购科技有限公司，意思是只需要一元钱，你就有机会买到参与活动的任意价格的商品。
> So I started my third job, which was Shenzhen One Yuan Cloud Purchase Technology Co., Ltd., which means that you only need one yuan to buy any price of goods participating in the activity.

- 在这家公司工作的时间是2016年到2017年差不多一年半时间，离开是因为这家公司的业务在2017年下半年被认为是违法了，公司停止了运营，虽然创始人又创建了一家新的公司，但我并没有加入。
> The time I worked in this company was almost a year and a half from 2016 to 2017. I left because the business of this company was considered illegal in the second half of 2017, and the company stopped operating. Although the founder created a new company, I did not join.
>
- 我刚加入的时候薪资增长了差不多一倍，也算是对我之前成长的肯定，这家公司是我巩固中级工程师的阶段
> When I just joined, my salary increased by almost twice, which is also a recognition of my growth before. This company is the stage for me to consolidate my mid-level engineer.

- 我下一份工作是联想信息科技有限公司，在这家公司参与了差不多三个主要项目的开发
  - 第一个是Lenovo Vantage, 一个可以在windows商店下载的程序，虽然没有多少用户就是了。我参与开发的是这个项目中的一个插件，可以让PC和手机进行数据交换，方便用PC管理多个手机的短信，照片，以及文件，开发一些需要手机和PC合作才能发挥的功能发挥或者比较方便的功能，比如短信群发，主要面向的海外客户, 手机端软件是印度摩托罗拉团队开发，与我们开发的PC端插件通讯
  > My next job was Lenovo Information Technology Co., Ltd. I participated in the development of almost three major projects
    > The first is Lenovo Vantage, a program that can be downloaded from the Windows Store, although there are not many users. The plugin I participated in developing is a plugin that can exchange data between PC and mobile phone, which is convenient for PC to manage multiple mobile phone SMS, photos, and files, and develop some functions that need to cooperate with PC and mobile phone to play or are more convenient, such as SMS group sending, mainly for overseas customers，The mobile phone software is developed by the Indian Motorola team, and communicates with the PC plug-in developed by us
    - 虽然这个项目感觉后面是失败了，没有什么用户，但我认为并不是我们团队的问题，而已领导层的决策问题
    > Although this project feels that it failed later, there are not many users, but I think it is not our team's problem, its the decision-making problem of the leadership
  - 第二个项目名称叫BTIT，主要是一个物联网服务，可以管理所有出售的智能音箱，智能插座，远程控制，数据采集, 设备和服务监控等，这个项目开发半年之后被另外一个比较大的团队抢走了。
    > The second project is called BTIT, which is mainly an IoT service that can manage all the smart speakers, smart sockets, remote control, data collection, device and service monitoring, etc. that are sold. This project was developed for half a year before it was taken away by another larger team.
  - 第三个项目叫LIPC，是一个拥有数百个服务的系统中的一个微服务，是一个订单代理系统，负责门户网站和账户服务系统的请求转发，和部分数据的处理，这个项目是我们与美国、乌克兰团队合作开发的，项目进展略微缓慢，到我离开的时候几乎没有什么任务和需求分配过来了
    > The third project is called LIPC, which is a microservice in a system with hundreds of services. It is an order proxy system that is responsible for forwarding requests from the portal website and account service system, and processing part of the data. This project is developed in cooperation with the US and Ukrainian teams. The project progress is slightly slow, and there are almost no tasks and requirements assigned when I left.

- 我在联想的工作时间是2017-2020，参与的项目虽然大多不算成功，但也成长了很多，离开时我基本上已经成长为了一个高级软件工程师。
> My work time at Lenovo was 2017-2020. Although most of the projects I participated in were not successful, I also grew a lot. When I left, I had basically grown into a senior software engineer.
