### 什么是Task

一系列动作的组合。我们会预先定义好需要做的哪些动作和相关参数，然后发送给Agv小车自动执行。

串行任务：A--->B--->C--->D

并行任务:  [A]：从A移动到B

​				 [B]：货叉从0.01m移动到0.5米

​				 [C]：感知激光开始扫描

### Task如何定义

以下定义了两个Task，每个Task都定义在{}里面，使用的json的格式定义

``` json
{
  "TaskType": "Unloading",
  "Path": [
   11,12
  ],
  "Z": 1.6,
  "OutZ": 0.05,
  "AdaptiveMode": true,
  "AdaptivePiling":true,
  "StoragePerceptionHeight": 0.2,
  "CompletedZWhenDetached":true,
  "VelocityLimitOfZ":0.2
}
{
  "TaskType" : "MoveTo",
  "Path" : [1711,38],
}
```

什么是Path:

Path定义在`Path.config`里面，任务里面的Path数组路径就是根据`Path.config`里面的No来进行索引

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Paths>
  <Path No="11" Detail="F;-16.302,5.519,0.000;-16.302,1.519,0.000" />
