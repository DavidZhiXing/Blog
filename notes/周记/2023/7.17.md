- **Because** of **the** 台风，I **was** worried about **parking** my car in the street **which might** lead to some bad result, so I came to **the** company at 8 **o'clock** to park my car in the under floor, and I **didn't** need to worry about if it **rained**.
- I found a good anime **yesterday called Kanojo wo Kakili**, and I **watched 6 episodes in one night**.
- Zombie 100 is also a good anime for me, like the walking dead style, but more fun and cool.
- I also **went** to swim at the weekend, but I **planned** to swim a day, but the **actually** is I just **swam half an hour to 1 hour a day...**
- I also learn**ed** to **know** how to swim from youtube and an swim club anime and the children's teacher, I still don't know the **rhythm** of breath.

以下是一些不够地道或者有错别字的地方的解释：

- becuase -> because （拼写错误）
- 台风 -> typhoon （如果要用英文表达，可以用这个词）
- I worry about that -> I was worried about （用过去时表示你之前的担心）
- park my car -> parking my car （用动名词作主语）
- maybe lead to -> which might lead to （用which引导定语从句，用might表示可能性）
- company -> the company （加定冠词表示特指的公司）
- oclock -> o'clock （加撇号表示缩写）
- neednt -> didn't need to （用过去时表示你之前不需要担心）
- if it raining -> if it rained （用过去时表示虚拟条件）
- yester -> yesterday （拼写错误）
- kanojo wo kakili -> Kanojo wo Kakili （动画名字应该首字母大写）
- watch 6 seriers a night -> watched 6 episodes in one night （用过去时表示你之前看了，用episodes表示动画的集数，用in one night表示一晚上）
- go to swim -> went to swim （用过去时表示你之前去游泳了）
- plan to swim a day -> planned to swim a day （用过去时表示你之前的计划）
- acctually -> actually （拼写错误）
- swin -> swam （过去式拼写错误）
- learn to knew -> learned to know （过去式拼写错误）
- rythim -> rhythm （拼写错误）

## OpenAI Translate
Due to the typhoon, I am concerned about parking my car on the street as it may result in some negative consequences. Therefore, I arrived at the company at 8 o'clock to park my car in the underground floor where I don't have to worry about rain.

Yesterday, I discovered a great anime called "Kanojo wo Kakili" and watched six episodes in one night.

"Zombie 100" is another anime that I enjoy. It has a similar style to "The Walking Dead," but with more fun and cool elements.

On weekends, I go swimming. Initially, my plan was to swim for an entire day; however, in reality, I only end up swimming for half an hour to one hour each day...

To learn how to swim properly, I relied on YouTube tutorials and an anime about a swim club. Additionally, there was a children's teacher who helped me out. Despite this guidance, I still struggle with finding the right breathing rhythm.
