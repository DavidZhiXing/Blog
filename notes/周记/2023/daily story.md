At 7.55, I arrived at the company.
The doorman informed me that the free car pod was not available and asked if I still wanted to come in.
I noticed another car behind me, making it difficult to turn back, so I decided to proceed.
I inquired about the cost with the doorman who estimated around 20. Since I would only be staying until midday, he suggested it might be around 10 more.
From now on, I have decided not to arrive at my company before 8 o'clock and instead park my car on the road.

Later, I had some noodles in the second building of the company.
Due to the intense heat, I posted on my social media: "Is this one of ShenZhen's hottest summers in recent years?" and received a reply.

While trying to access my backup code, I discovered that it was encrypted and unreadable. This left me wondering if there is any way to decrypt these files. 
I attempted various methods such as using git revert and git checkout but none of them worked. It's interesting because all file names are visible along with changes made by an encryption software.

Yesterday, I planned on going swimming but found it too expensive with too many people present. Additionally, the water depth was only 1.4 meters which seemed shallow.
As a result, I opted for swimming at a district near my home where although depths ranged from 1.2-1.4 meters and perhaps water quality wasn't ideal,
there were fewer people allowing me to swim undisturbed for just thirty minutes.
