- I have got a great growth in freestyle swimming. I was axious about the pull stroke and catch stroke, I know the correct posture, I just can't do it myself. I don't know why, and my speed is very flow. to finish the 1000 meters , I spent more than 30 minuts, even slow than the beginner.
From recent video, I found that the nomal speed is 100 meter in 1 minuts.

than I try jus move my arm, and I felt the speed , and I can do the correct posture, the pace even close to 100 meter per minut.
I think the error is my rotation is at the same time of pull and catch stroke, I dont need to focus on the rotation of body, looklike it will turn naturely. like I don't need to focus on the leg kick, when I focus on it, it will over bench the knee.

at a result, I got to the junior from below to beginner, happy.
