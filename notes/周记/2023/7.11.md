## The AI Version(GPT)
At 7.55, I arrived at the company.
The doorman informed me that the free car pod was not available and asked if I still wanted to come in.
I noticed another car behind me, making it difficult to turn back, so I decided to proceed.
I inquired about the cost with the doorman who estimated around 20. Since I would only be staying until midday, he suggested it might be around 10 more.
From now on, I have decided not to arrive at my company before 8 o'clock and instead park my car on the road.

Later, I had some noodles in the second building of the company.
Due to the intense heat, I posted on my social media: "Is this one of ShenZhen's hottest summers in recent years?" and received a reply.

While trying to access my backup code, I discovered that it was encrypted and unreadable. This left me wondering if there is any way to decrypt these files. 
I attempted various methods such as using git revert and git checkout but none of them worked. It's interesting because all file names are visible along with changes made by an encryption software.

Yesterday, I planned on going swimming but found it too expensive with too many people present. Additionally, the water depth was only 1.4 meters which seemed shallow.
As a result, I opted for swimming at a district near my home where although depths ranged from 1.2-1.4 meters and perhaps water quality wasn't ideal,
there were fewer people allowing me to swim undisturbed for just thirty minutes.

7:55 I arrived at the company.

The parking attendant said there was no free parking spot available, and asked me if I still wanted to come in.

I saw that there was another car behind me

and it was too narrow to turn back, so I decided to come in.

I asked him how much it would cost me, he said around 20 yuan, I said I would only stay until noon, he said then it might cost 10 yuan more.

I decided I would never come to my company before 8 o'clock, I would park my car on the street.

I ate some noodles in the second building of the company.

It was too hot, so I posted on my WeChat Moments: Is this the hottest summer in recent years in Shenzhen? I got a reply on it.

I found that my backup code had been encrypted, so I couldn't read the original codes. I wondered if I could decrypt the files.

I tried using git revert, git checkout, but it was funny that they didn't work. I wanted to know why. I could see all the files with names, and all the branches, and all the files had been changed by the encryption software.

Yesterday I was going to swim, but I thought the fee was too expensive, and there were too many people, and it was not deep enough, just 1.4 meters.

So, I decided to swim at the pool in my neighborhood, although it was only 1.2 to 1.4 meters deep, and the length was not so long, maybe the water quality was not so good.

But I thought there would not be so many people, and I could swim for 30 minutes.
