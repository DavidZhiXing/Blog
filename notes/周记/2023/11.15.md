## The routine of try wpf
want to change the binding data from a single data to a list of data, but failed.
- try to set the single data when selected index changed, but the ui doesn't change at all.
- try to set the Dictionary Data to a ObservableCollection, but still not change, I dont know why.
- change the binding data to my original dictionary, It can change the interface manually
- try to add a data trigger to the single component
    - the trigger add method not in the resources
    - the visibility property cannot in a setter directly
    - set the Grid.Visibility to a property, but the ui is not shown as expected
    - change the trigger to a style.trigger dont add the trigger target.
    - add the target type to the style, but the ui is not shown as expected
    - test add a converter to binding the visibility, not write it as a resource, build fail
    - ask ai how to add a converter in the xamal.
    - add the namespace and binding to the xaml
    - finally, It work, but looks a little stupid.
    - anyway, it works.
    - const my 1 day time which supposed just 1 hour.
    - what a suck day and task.

## Attempting to Use WPF

I attempted to change the binding data from a single data to a list of data, but unfortunately, I was unsuccessful. Here are the steps I took:

- I tried to set the single data when the selected index changed, but the UI didn't change at all.
- I attempted to set the dictionary data to an ObservableCollection, but it still didn't change. I'm not sure why.
- I changed the binding data back to my original dictionary, which allowed me to change the interface manually.
- I tried to add a data trigger to the single component, but encountered some issues:
    - The trigger add method was not in the resources.
    - The visibility property cannot be set directly in a setter.
    - I set the Grid.Visibility to a property, but the UI did not show as expected.
    - I changed the trigger to a style.trigger without adding the trigger target.
    - I added the target type to the style, but the UI still did not show as expected.
    - I tested adding a converter to bind the visibility, but did not write it as a resource and the build failed.
    - I asked AI how to add a converter in the XAML.
    - I added the namespace and binding to the XAML.
    - Finally, it worked, but it looks a little silly.
    - Anyway, it works.
- This task took me one day, which was supposed to only take one hour.
- What a terrible day and task.
