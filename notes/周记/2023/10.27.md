## Free Style Swimming
- Yesterday I was so frustrated about the freestyle swimming, I can't pulling water effectively. And I don't know how to improve it, I watch the youtube video many times, but I can't do it like the professional swimmer in the video.
- But I try many times, and I got some progress.
- This is how I tries:
    - felt the support of water when pulling it, but I get tired very quickly and the body can not key the balance.
    - try to slow down my legs and felt the action step;
    - try to relax my hip and the legs
    - try to reduce the angle of my legs
    - try to relax my shoulder at the finish arm moving cycle
    - try to breath fruently
    
Finally, I got some small progress. I can really relax my hip and shoulder; I dont feel tired at all. The speed is not so slow. I even can singing when swimming. I got reall happy day.

So, if the free style swimming is a big project of my work. I dont know how to push the progress. I can try to break the progress to very very small steps. And I can beleive It will reach the goal at last or late.
