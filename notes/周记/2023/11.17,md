## The leaning of freestyle swimming
### Learning from english channel
- Searching the keyword [free style], select the video looks better, really find some cool videos
- Knowing the best 理论 of free style, knowing what need to do while freestyle swimming
- problem: I can't do it as the video shows, I can't do it as the 理论 says, my progress is very slow, or even no progress
- I try to watch the same video again and again, try to do it again and again, but still no progress, I dont know why
### Catch my practice video
- Recording my practice video, find its many problems, still don't know how to solve it
### Watching the video of Chinese MJ
- Also watch again and again, but pratice get better again and again. The pace get finally get better: from 3:30 to 2:30 ~ 2:00
- But I felt very tire, and its hard to break under 2:00
### Watching the video of Japanese
- I find out the point to improve: I have breath too long, and I try to shorten the breath time, and I find out the pace get better, finally I can break 2:00
and even not so tire
## Question produced
- Why I can't learn from the video of English Channel?
- Am i too beleving the english channel? or the language is the problem?
- Why the breath problem is not so mentioned in the english channel and chinese channel?
## The Conclusion
- Learning the best poses or techniques is not the best for the beginner
- The beginner should have a routine to pratice, gradually improve the skill
- From the videos: although there ara many high quality english videos, but It still have so chances for the video creators.
    - you can find the difference of the videos of Chinese and English and Japanese
    - maybe english video is good for the whole clear theory, but not so good for step by step, or the training routine
    - you still have the chance to create video like this, the important thing is to find the difference, and find the chance
