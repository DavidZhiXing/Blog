He want me to give a desk software to him.
I was confusing that why he didn't ask other colleagues.
I don't want to talk to him.
But I still give the soft to him. Why?
and I was very worried about that if the soft is working well.
actually, I was not sure, I haven't tested it.
But I transferred the soft to him directly.
finnaly, he told me the soft couldn't open with no error log.
I thought it was crazy. Why I didn't open it myself untill he told me it was not work?
I have to run the soft and found that the config has been changed.
I roll back the config. And the soft could run well.
then I sent the hold directly to him without crypto and it surelly worked well.
So does it suck or happy?
