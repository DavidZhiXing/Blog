If your colleague has a design for a specific feature, but you think it may not be the best design, there are several ways you can approach the situation to improve team collaboration and support the success of the project. Here are a few ideas and examples:

Communicate openly and honestly. Instead of criticizing or dismissing your colleague's design outright, try to have an open and honest conversation about the design and your concerns. This can help to foster a collaborative and supportive team environment, where everyone's ideas and concerns are taken into account. For example:

Instead of saying "Your design is bad," you could say "I have some concerns about the design. Can we discuss it further to see if there are any improvements we can make?"
Instead of saying "Your idea won't work," you could say "I'm not sure if your idea will work in this situation. Can you explain the reasoning behind it, so we can evaluate it together?"
Offer constructive feedback. Instead of simply pointing out the problems with your colleague's design, try to provide constructive feedback that suggests ways to improve the design. This can help your colleague to learn and grow, and it can also help to improve the overall quality of the design. For example:

Instead of saying "Your design is too complex," you could say "I think your design could be simplified by removing some of the unnecessary features. Can we brainstorm together to come up with a simpler and more elegant solution?"
Instead of saying "Your design is not efficient," you could say "I think your design could be more efficient by using a different data structure. Can we compare the performance of different data structures to see which one is the best fit for our needs?"
Consider different perspectives. Instead of focusing solely on your own perspective and opinions, try to consider the perspectives of other team members and stakeholders. This can help to ensure that the design takes into account the needs and goals of the entire team, and it can also help to prevent conflicts and misunderstandings. For example:

Instead of saying "Your design doesn't match my vision," you could say "I understand that your design is based on your own vision. Can you explain your vision to me, so I can see if it aligns with the vision of the rest of the team?"
Instead of saying "Your design is not practical," you could say "I understand that your design is based on your own expertise and experience. Can you explain the practicality of your design to me, so I can see if it aligns with the goals and constraints of the project?"
Overall, the key to improving team collaboration and supporting the success of the project is to communicate openly and honestly, offer constructive feedback, and consider different perspectives.
