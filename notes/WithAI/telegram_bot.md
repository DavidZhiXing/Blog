## How to write a telegram bot?
To create a Telegram bot that can search for books by name and provide download links, you will need to do the following:

First, you will need to create a Telegram bot using the BotFather tool in Telegram. This will give you a unique API token that you can use to access the Telegram API and create your bot.

Next, you will need to create a server-side application that can handle requests to the Telegram API. This application will need to be able to receive messages from Telegram users and respond to them with the appropriate information or actions.

You will then need to use an API or database of book information to search for books by name and retrieve the necessary information, such as the download link for the book.

Finally, you will need to integrate all of these components into a single system that can handle user requests, search for books, and provide download links.


``` csharp
namespace TelegramBot
{
    public class Bot
    {
        private readonly string _botToken;
        private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;

        public Bot(string botToken)
        {
            _botToken = botToken;
            _httpClient = new HttpClient();
        }

        public async Task SendMessage(long chatId, string text)
        {
            var request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Post,
                $"https://api.telegram.org/bot{_botToken}/sendMessage");

            var message = new
            {
                chat_id = chatId,
                text = text
            };

            request.Content = new StringContent(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(message),
                Encoding.UTF8, "application/json");

            var response = await _httpClient.SendAsync(request);
            response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
        }
    }

    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var bot = new Bot("YOUR_BOT_TOKEN");
            bot.SendMessage(YOUR_CHAT_ID, "Hello, world!").Wait();
        }
    }
}
```
## How to extend the bot?
If you want to add more features to your Telegram bot, you can do so by making additional API calls to the Telegram API. You can find a full list of the available API methods and their parameters in the Telegram Bot API documentation.

For example, if you want to add a feature that allows users to send photos to your bot, you can use the sendPhoto API method. 

## How to deploy the bot?
To deploy your Telegram bot, you will need to host it on a server that is always online and can receive incoming HTTP requests from the Telegram servers. This will allow your bot to receive and respond to messages and other events from users on Telegram.

There are many different options for hosting your Telegram bot, including cloud hosting platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), as well as traditional web hosting providers.

Once you have chosen a hosting platform, you will need to publish your bot's code to the server and configure it to start running when the server starts. The exact steps for doing this will depend on the hosting platform and the programming language and frameworks that you used to write your bot.

Once your bot is deployed and running on the server, you will need to configure the webhooks for your bot. Webhooks are a way for the Telegram servers to send events and messages to your bot's server as soon as they happen, so that your bot can respond to them in real-time.

To set up webhooks for your bot, you will need to make an API call to the setWebhook endpoint. You can do this by sending a POST request to the following URL:

https://api.telegram.org/bot<BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook
Replace <BOT_TOKEN> with your bot's token. In the request body, you will need to pass the URL of your bot's server, as well as the public SSL certificate for your server. This will allow the Telegram servers to securely send events and messages to your bot's server.
