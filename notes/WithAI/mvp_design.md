Example of a WPF MVVM user interface for business process modeling and execution

This user interface includes the following key elements:

A main navigation area on the left, which allows the user to switch between different views and features of the user interface.
A content area on the right, which displays the current view or feature that the user has selected from the navigation area.
A process editor view, which allows the user to create and edit business processes using a visual workflow editor.
