- not playing games but watching youtube in my daily life
- reading books in kindle (janpanese, zero gara yisekai hajimemaru)
- typing without looking for pin number, '()', '/' and '[]' '-' '=' 
- practicing typing the code 
- thinking about the "what is the base knowlege I should master?" "why I felt not so secure and chaosedï¼Ÿ" "why they typing so fast and fluently in the mocking video" "how I can reach that level?"
- And I would try this method. "In typing, the basic is typing eaching word without the automatically inputting and the paste commad" "looking more videos about programming typing"
- In coding, I would implement every feature that look not so cool to make me feel and get the power and strength of the sprite;
